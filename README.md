# EFC - Electron File Converter
### Lightweight FFMPEG-based Media Converter
EFC is a lightweight FFMPEG-based media file converter made with Electron.js and vanilla javascript.

## Why Use EFC?
This project was designed as a user-friendly and resource-efficient alternative to Handbrake, a popular FFMPEG media converter.  
If you want to do simple modifications (visual, metadata, type) to a media file, this is the converter for you (only 250mbs!).  
It's completely open-source, and uses JS instead of React to be as lightweight as possible.
